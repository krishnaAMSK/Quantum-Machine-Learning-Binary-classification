# Quantum-ML-classification

Abstract of Research
This research intends to introduce a possible application of Quantum Computing to a real-world dataset, binary classification for wine quality. The Quantum model used in this research is based on Bayesian theorem, and its circuit includes quantum gates used widely, such as X-Gate, CNOT Gate, RY Gate and CRY Gate, as well as those that are unique in this research, CCRY Gate and CCCRY Gate. Just like classical machine learning models, addition of attributes enhanced model accuracy on a test dataset, and a quantum machine learning model built for this research achieved slightly better performance than a classical machine learning model, random forest algorithm.
